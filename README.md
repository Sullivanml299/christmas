# Christmas Games! 
This is a small Android game designed as a present for my niece and nephews over the course of about a week. It Included various puzzles that utilized some unique phone utilities such as the GPS and accelerometer.

## Planet Puzzle

This puzzle was designed for my younger nephew who is obsessed with the planets. It's a simple ordering puzzle that uses a draggable grid.

## GPS Scavenger Hunt

This puzzle used GPS to lead the kids to locations outside of my house where they needed to look for pieces of a QR code. I created some simple particle effects using Flutter's Canvas and Custom Painter to create "fireflies" that would lead them to each puzzle piece. As the kids moved closer to the GPS location of one of the puzzle pieces, the fireflies would change color and begin moving faster. There were also vibration and audio cues that increased in frequency as they got closer to the relevant piece.

Once they found all of the pieces, they had to scan the assembled QR code to complete the challenge.

## Clock Riddle

This is a simple riddle targeted at my niece and oldest nephew. The riddle helped them identify the proper time to enter and complete the puzzle.

## Accelerometer Red Light Green Light Obstacle Course

This was a combination of Redlight Greenlight and a good old fashioned obstacle course! I made the obstacle course in my basement out of blankets, pillows, and fishing line with Christmas bells tied to them. I then used a runner's arm band to attach the phone to the curren player. The app gave the player visual and audio cues to indicate when they could and couldn't move. While the "light" was red, the phone's accelerometer was used to detect any movement. If movement was detected, a record scratch sound played. If we heard a record scratch sound or a Christmas bell ring we would spray them with Silly String and the next player got a chance to play. At the end of the course was a QR code that they could scan to complete the challenge.

## Identifying Rocks

For this puzzle I bought one of those of-the-shelf sandstone blocks with pretty rocks embedded in it. The kids had to dig the rocks out and identify their corresponding value using the rock chart in the app to deduce a 4 digit pin number that would complete the challenge. 

## Swapper Puzzle

The last puzzle was a simple picture swap puzzle that gave them a hint as to where their present was hidden. There present, in this case, was a PS5 that my parents' bought them and generously allowed me to use as the reward for the game!
